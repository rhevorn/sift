# Screenshot module

Capture flow:

1. `ScreenshotController` shows dim overlays (`ScreenshotSelectionSession`).
2. `ScreenshotCapture` waits until those overlay window IDs appear in
   `SCShareableContent`, then freezes displays under them via ScreenCaptureKit
   (with short retries—new panels are often missing from the first query).
3. The user drags a region; `ScreenshotGeometry` maps AppKit screen space to CGImage pixels.
4. `ScreenshotEditorController` presents annotation UI on an AppKit-frozen desktop backdrop.
5. Export draws strokes through `ScreenshotStrokeRenderer` (same geometry as the canvas preview).

Coordinate spaces:

- Selection / display frames: AppKit, origin bottom-left, Y up.
- Editor model and SwiftUI canvas: top-left, Y down.
- `ScreenshotGeometry.pixelRect` converts selection → pixel crop with the Y flip.

Permissions:

- Requires Screen Recording (`NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription`).
- `ScreenshotPermission` preflights access and can open System Settings.
